# Supply Chain Optimization Dashboard using Power BI

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **Supply Chain Optimization** by utilizing data insights to improve aspects such as inventory management, cost reduction, lead time optimization, and profitability.

## Objectives
The objectives of this project are:
- **Increase stock visibility** by analyzing stock levels and shortages.
- **Identify key factors** influencing shipping costs and lead time variability.
- **Maximize product availability** by optimizing order quantities and reducing lead times.
- **Optimize profit margins** through better cost management.
- **Minimize defect rates** by identifying suppliers contributing to higher defect rates.

## Data Sources
The data used in this project was sourced from **MySQL** and **Excel** and was analyzed using **Power BI** for visualization and insights.

### MySQL Analysis
- **Data Management**: All data points, including product types, stock levels, and defect rates, were extracted and analyzed from a MySQL database.

### Excel Analysis
- **Data Handling**: The dataset was pre-processed in Excel, where key metrics such as revenue generated, number of products sold, and manufacturing costs were organized.

### Power BI(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p_6bgs6Xlwf6mqJDEl2_SsTaa31ufl0C/view?usp=sharing)
Power BI was used to create dashboards and visualizations, providing key insights into the supply chain.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
Here are the primary insights gained from the analysis:

1. **Total Revenue**: 577,000  
   Total revenue generated from product sales.

2. **Average Product Price**: 49.46  
   The average price of all products in the dataset.

3. **Total Products Sold**: 46,000  
   The number of units sold across all product categories.

4. **Average Manufacturing Cost**: 47.27  
   The average cost incurred during product manufacturing.

5. **Total Available Products**: 4,840  
   The current stock availability for all product categories.

6. **Total Stock Value**: 4,777  
   The total value of the stock currently available.

## Insights

1. **Revenue vs. Product Type**  
   Products with a higher price tend to generate more revenue, but certain product types with moderate pricing also show significant revenue contribution, indicating high sales volume.

2. **Stock Levels and Shortages**  
   Some product categories are at risk of stock shortages. There is an opportunity to improve order planning to avoid potential stockouts.

3. **Lead Time Variability**  
   Lead times vary significantly for different product categories. Optimizing lead time consistency, especially for high-demand products, could lead to better inventory management.

4. **High Defect Rates for Certain Suppliers**  
   Suppliers with higher defect rates are contributing to a significant loss in quality. A strategic partnership with better-performing suppliers can improve product quality and reduce costs associated with defects.

5. **Shipping Costs Impact on Profitability**  
   Products with longer lead times and higher shipping costs are negatively impacting overall profit margins. Optimizing transportation routes or considering alternative shipping carriers could reduce shipping costs.

6. **Cost Management Opportunities**  
   While the average product price is relatively high, the manufacturing costs are close to the average price. Focusing on reducing manufacturing costs through lean operations can help improve profit margins.

## Conclusion
This project provides comprehensive insights into the supply chain, helping stakeholders to optimize processes, reduce costs, and improve profitability. Key metrics such as revenue, stock levels, and defect rates were effectively visualized and analyzed, enabling data-driven decision-making.
